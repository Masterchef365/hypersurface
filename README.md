# Hypersurface
A data structure and a set of algorithms for manipulating regular cells on the
N-dimensional hypersurface of a M-dimensional hypercube.

## Examples
Demonstrating the realtime viability of this datastructure is a wave simulation using the 2D finite difference method on the surface of a 4D hypercube.
The visualization looks something like this:
